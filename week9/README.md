Week 9

## Project Presentations
Next week, we'll be presenting our projects! This is a low-stakes, low-pressure presentation.
The main goal is to just show off your projects to the rest of the class and determine who will represent Deploy
in the HackCville project showcase.

### What we're looking for:
- **5-8 minute presentation about your project**
- **Talk about the goal/mission of your web app and why you're building it**
  - e.g. Modernize freight records because the current shipping industry still uses fax machines and filing cabinets
  - e.g. build GrubHub for dog food because dogs get hungry too (and their's a large market in doting pet owners)
- **Optional: Give a brief live-demo of your project**
- **Talk about the technical challenges you ran into**
  - What tech did you use?
  - What's the most interesting feature you've built so far?
- **Talk about what your project would look like in the long-term.**
  - What features would you add?
- **Talk about how you would scale your project to millions of users**
  - Include a system design diagram of what your project would look like scaled up
    - These should look similar to the diagrams we've drawn in class
    - See [the system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions)
    for more examples.
  - Discuss scoping
    - What features do you plan to support?
  - Discuss your workload assumptions
    - Is it read-heavy? Write-heavy? Both?
    - Do you face unique challenges?
      - e.g. blob storage, video streaming, job scheduling?
  - How does your system design reflect the scope and assumptions that you chose?
  - How would you deploy this on AWS?

#### After each group presents, we'll all help choose one group to present during the HackCville project showcase.
  
## Extra credit: Analyze an existing open-source system.
- Find an open source project that you're interested and dive into the code to try and see how it works.
- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) has many different open source
projects and detailed explanations of how they work if you need inspiration.
